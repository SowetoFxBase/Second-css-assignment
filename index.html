              Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet
              the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not
              inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
              plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it
              science, people were selecting the best breeds."</span>
